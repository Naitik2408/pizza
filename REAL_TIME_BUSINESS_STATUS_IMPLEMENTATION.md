# Real-Time Business Status Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds real-time business status updates throughout the application and prevents order placement when the restaurant is closed, both on the frontend and backend.

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- **Fixed Socket Import**: Changed from `require()` to proper ES6 import for socket utilities
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Added proper socket listener for `businessStatusChanged` events
- **Business Status Check**: Added validation before allowing items to be added to cart
- **Menu Navigation Protection**: Prevents navigation to menu when restaurant is closed
- **Visual Indicators**: Added disabled styles for cart buttons when closed
- **Socket Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of socket listeners on component unmount

**Key Features:**
- Real-time status updates without page refresh
- Visual feedback when restaurant is closed (disabled buttons, different text)
- Prevents any cart operations when closed

### 2. Menu Screen (`app/(tabs)/menu.tsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- **Business Status State**: Added business status state management
- **Socket Integration**: Added socket listeners for real-time status updates
- **Add to Cart Protection**: Prevents adding items to cart when closed
- **Visual Feedback**: Disabled "Add to Cart" button with appropriate messaging
- **Alert Messages**: Shows user-friendly alerts when trying to order while closed

**Key Features:**
- Real-time status updates
- Prevents item addition when closed
- Clear user feedback

### 3. Cart Component (`src/components/features/cart/Cart.tsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- **Business Status State**: Added business status state and fetch functionality
- **Socket Integration**: Real-time status updates via socket listeners
- **Checkout Protection**: Prevents checkout process when restaurant is closed
- **Button State Management**: Checkout button shows "Restaurant Closed" when closed
- **Status Propagation**: Passes business status to PaymentMethod component

**Key Features:**
- Blocks entire checkout flow when closed
- Real-time status updates
- Clear visual indicators

### 4. Payment Method Component (`src/components/features/cart/PaymentMethod.tsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- **Business Status Prop**: Added businessStatus prop to component interface
- **Order Validation**: Checks business status before processing any payment
- **Early Validation**: Prevents payment processing when restaurant is closed

**Key Features:**
- Double-layer protection for order placement
- Clear error messages

## Backend Changes

### 1. Order Controller (`controllers/orderController.js`)
**Changes Made:**
- **Business Status Check**: Added validation in `placeOrder` function
- **Error Response**: Returns appropriate error message when restaurant is closed
- **Status Integration**: Uses existing `getBusinessStatus()` method from Business model

**Key Features:**
- Server-side validation prevents orders when closed
- Proper error messaging
- Uses existing business logic

## Socket Implementation

### Real-time Status Updates
- **Event**: `businessStatusChanged`
- **Trigger**: When admin changes business status manually or scheduled hours change
- **Listeners**: Home screen, Menu screen, Cart component
- **Data**: `{ isOpen: boolean, reason: string, manualOverride: boolean }`

### Socket Cleanup
- Proper event listener cleanup on component unmount
- Prevents memory leaks and duplicate listeners

## Business Status Logic

### Status Determination
The business status is determined by:
1. **Manual Override**: Admin can manually open/close with custom reason
2. **Scheduled Hours**: Automatic open/close based on configured hours
3. **Day Schedule**: Can be closed on specific days

### Status Object Structure
```javascript
{
  isOpen: boolean,
  reason: string, // e.g., "Open until 10:00 PM", "Manually closed", "Opens at 9:00 AM"
  manualOverride: boolean
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- **Disabled Buttons**: Grayed out when restaurant is closed
- **Status Badges**: "OPEN NOW" / "CLOSED" badges with appropriate colors
- **Button Text**: Changes to "Restaurant Closed" when applicable
- **Icons**: Remove action icons (like arrows) when disabled

### Error Messages
- **Consistent Messaging**: All error messages include the closure reason
- **User-Friendly**: Clear explanation of why action is blocked
- **Actionable**: Tells users when to try again

### Real-time Updates
- **No Refresh Needed**: Status updates immediately when changed
- **All Components**: Home, Menu, and Cart all update simultaneously
- **Smooth Transition**: Status changes reflect instantly

## Protection Layers

### Multiple Validation Points
1. **Frontend UI**: Disabled buttons and immediate validation
2. **Frontend Logic**: JavaScript validation before API calls
3. **Backend API**: Server-side validation before processing orders

### Order Flow Protection
1. **Cart Addition**: Can't add items when closed
2. **Menu Navigation**: Can't browse menu when closed (optional)
3. **Checkout Initiation**: Can't start checkout when closed
4. **Payment Processing**: Can't process payment when closed
5. **Order Creation**: Backend rejects order when closed

## Technical Implementation

### Socket Integration
- Uses existing socket infrastructure
- Leverages `getSocket()`, `onSocketEvent()`, `offSocketEvent()` utilities
- Proper TypeScript typing for socket events

### State Management
- React state for business status in components
- Real-time updates via socket events
- Consistent state across all components

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when socket connection fails
- User-friendly error messages
- No breaking of existing functionality

## Testing Considerations

### Test Scenarios
1. **Manual Status Change**: Admin closes restaurant manually
2. **Scheduled Hours**: Restaurant closes/opens based on schedule
3. **Socket Connection**: Real-time updates work correctly
4. **Order Protection**: All order flows blocked when closed
5. **Visual Updates**: UI reflects status changes immediately

### Edge Cases
- Socket connection failures
- Network interruptions
- Status changes during checkout process
- Multiple tab/window synchronization

## Benefits

### For Customers
- Clear indication of restaurant availability
- Prevents wasted time trying to place orders when closed
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Better user experience with immediate feedback

### For Restaurant
- Prevents orders when unable to fulfill them
- Reduces customer complaints about delayed/cancelled orders
- Automated enforcement of business hours
- Manual override capability for special situations

### For Developers
- Robust error handling
- Real-time functionality
- Consistent implementation across components
- Easy to maintain and extend

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
- **Countdown Timer**: Show when restaurant will open/close
- **Notification Subscription**: Alert users when restaurant opens
- **Partial Menu**: Allow browsing but not ordering when closed
- **Pre-orders**: Allow orders for future time slots
- **Delivery Zone Status**: Different status for different areas

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for real-time business status management with multiple layers of protection and excellent user experience.
