# Delivery Socket & Alarm Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Periodic Polling Removed**
- **Problem**: The page was auto-refreshing every 30 seconds due to an interval 
- **Solution**: Commented out the useEffect that was causing periodic refresh since we're using real-time sockets

### 2. **Socket Event Names Corrected**
- **Problem**: Frontend was listening for wrong socket events:
  - Frontend: `orderAssignedToDelivery` ❌
  - Backend: `new_order_assigned` ✅
  
- **Solution**: Updated socket event listeners to match backend events:
  - `new_order_assigned` - for new orders assigned to delivery agent
  - `assigned_order_update` - for order status updates
  - `order_unassigned` - for order cancellations/unassignments

### 3. **Data Structure Mapping**
- **Problem**: Frontend was expecting different data structure than backend was sending
- **Solution**: Updated handlers to work with correct data fields:
  - `orderData._id` instead of `orderData.id`
  - `orderData.customerName` instead of `orderData.customer.name`
  - `orderData.orderNumber` instead of `orderData.id`

### 4. **Enhanced Socket Connection Debugging**
- **Problem**: No visibility into socket connection issues
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive logging for:
  - Socket connection status
  - User ID and role verification
  - Event reception debugging
  - Socket room joining confirmation

### 5. **Alarm Service Error Handling**
- **Problem**: If alarm service failed, the entire handler would fail
- **Solution**: Added try-catch blocks with fallback behavior to ensure alerts are still shown

## Key Changes Made

### `/app/delivery/assignedOrders.tsx`

1. **Removed periodic refresh interval** (lines 604-612)
2. **Updated socket event listeners**:
   - `orderAssignedToDelivery` → `new_order_assigned`
   - `orderStatusUpdated` → `assigned_order_update`
   - `orderCancelled` → `order_unassigned`
3. **Enhanced socket connection logic** with better debugging
4. **Fixed data structure mapping** in event handlers
5. **Added comprehensive logging** for debugging
6. **Improved error handling** for alarm services

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Check Console Logs
Look for these logs in your development console:
```
🔌 Setting up socket for delivery agent: { userId: 'xxx', role: 'delivery', hasToken: true, ... }
✅ Socket connected in delivery orders screen
🔗 Socket ID: xxx
👤 Rejoining rooms with: { userId: 'xxx', role: 'delivery' }
🔔 Socket event received: new_order_assigned { ... }
```

### 2. Verify Socket Connection
- Check if the socket is connecting properly
- Verify the user ID and role are correct
- Ensure the socket is joining the correct rooms

### 3. Test Order Assignment
When an order is assigned to the delivery agent, you should see:
1. Console log: `🔔 Socket event received: new_order_assigned`
2. Console log: `✅ New order assigned to delivery agent:`
3. Console log: `🔊 Triggering system-level alert...`
4. Console log: `📢 Setting urgent alarm...`
5. Alert popup: "🍕 New Delivery Assignment!"
6. Orders list should update automatically

### 4. Common Issues to Check

#### Socket Not Connecting:
- Check if the backend server is running
- Verify the API_URL is correct
- Check if the authentication token is valid

#### Socket Events Not Received:
- Verify the backend is emitting the correct events
- Check if the delivery agent is properly authenticated
- Ensure the socket is joining the correct rooms

#### Alarm Not Ringing:
- Check if notification permissions are granted
- Verify the alarm service is properly configured
- Check if the device has Do Not Disturb mode enabled

### 5. Manual Testing

You can use the test script created at `/test-delivery-socket.js`:
1. Update the API_URL, DELIVERY_AGENT_TOKEN, and DELIVERY_AGENT_ID
2. Run: `node test-delivery-socket.js`
3. This will help verify socket connection and events from backend

## Expected Behavior

### When a new order is assigned:
1. Socket receives `new_order_assigned` event
2. Haptic feedback is triggered
3. System-level alarm/notification is sent
4. Native alarm service is triggered
5. Alert dialog is shown to user
6. Orders list updates automatically (no refresh needed)

### When order status changes:
1. Socket receives `assigned_order_update` event
2. Orders list updates automatically
3. If order is delivered/cancelled, it's removed from list after 2 seconds

### When order is unassigned:
1. Socket receives `order_unassigned` event
2. Warning haptic feedback is triggered
3. Alert dialog is shown
4. Order is removed from list immediately

## Next Steps

1. Test the socket connection and events
2. Verify alarm/notification permissions
3. Test with actual order assignments
4. Check if orders update in real-time without manual refresh
5. Verify alarms trigger when new orders are assigned
