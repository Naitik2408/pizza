echo "üß™ TESTING ESCALATING ALERT TYPE FIX"
echo "===================================="
echo ""
echo "üéØ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   - 'escalating_alert' notifications were not being processed"
echo "   - Type check in _layout.tsx didn't include 'escalating_alert'"
echo "   - Sound/vibration only worked for 'critical_order_alert' but not escalating alerts"
echo ""
echo "üõ†Ô∏è FIX APPLIED:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Added 'escalating_alert' to notification type check in _layout.tsx"
echo "   ‚úÖ Added 'escalating_alert' to notification handler priority check"
echo "   ‚úÖ Fixed backend notification priority from 'max' to 'high' (valid Expo value)"
echo ""
echo "üì± TESTING APPROACH:"
echo "   1. Place a new order from customer app"
echo "   2. Observe that initial notification works (sound/vibration)"
echo "   3. Wait for 30s escalating alert"
echo "   4. Check console logs show 'Type match: true' for escalating_alert"
echo "   5. Verify escalating alert also triggers sound/vibration"
echo ""
echo "üîç WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN LOGS:"
echo "   - üè∑Ô∏è Notification type: escalating_alert"
echo "   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Type match: true (not false anymore)"
echo "   - üö® Triggering ENHANCED alert for order: XXXX"
echo "   - üîî Starting in-app alert..."
echo "   - ‚úÖ ORDER ALERT STARTED SUCCESSFULLY!"
echo ""
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è BACKGROUND/CLOSED APP LIMITATION:"
echo "   - System notifications appear but may not trigger sound/alarm due to OS restrictions"
echo "   - This is a known limitation of Expo managed workflow"
echo "   - Consider using native build or EAS for true background alarms"
